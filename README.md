# Podcastindex aggregator

A simple prototype to illustrate how Python/Kubernetes based stack can be used to organise data processing infrastructure.

At the moment prototype covers data flow and basic Python layout for ETL jobs - see [aggregator ETL](etl).

Ideally it should run inside Kubernetes cluster, which can be provisioned with terraform in Linode, AWS or similar cloud providers.
